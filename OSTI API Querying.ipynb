    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is setup to query the [OSTI.gov](https://www.OSTI.gov) API for project records. The goals for the code located herein are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine what fields are available for different records in OSTI\n",
    "2. Design a DOE Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) query that only pulls that technology office's data\n",
    "    * **Note:** this required `{'sponsoring_org': '\"EE-4S\"'}` in order to work the same as the browser-based search query. It appears that the syntax of the API and of the browser-based search is not fully harmonized right now, although I'm told it will be in the future.\n",
    "3. Build the query to work using an arbitrarily-large list of formatted project IDs, assuming the Solar Information Management System (SIMS) project code syntax as the input.\n",
    "    * **Note:** SIMS is an internal DOE system\n"
