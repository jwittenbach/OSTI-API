    "This notebook is setup to query the [OSTI.gov](https://www.OSTI.gov) API for project records. The goals for the code located herein are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine what fields are available for different records in OSTI\n",
    "2. Design a DOE Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) query that only pulls that technology office's data\n",
    "3. Build the query to work using an arbitrarily-large list of formatted project IDs, assuming the Solar Information Management System (SIMS) project code syntax as the input.\n",

    "2. Figure out exactly what params are most useful using the [OSTI API docs](https://www.osti.gov/api/v1/docs)."

    "\n",
    "1. Using [this search URL](https://www.osti.gov/search/sort:publication_date%20desc/sponsor-org:EE-4S#), I'm able to get results that are specific to the solar office (SETO = EE-4S) just fine. *But if I try to use the same parameters for the API call, I get nonsensical results*. \n",
    "    * If I try to sort by publication date without specifying a sort order, I don't see any really default ordering so I may as well have not done the sort in the first place\n",
    "    * If I try to specify the sort order by using the parameter order: desc, it fails. The API documentation is flawed in this way, because really what it wants you to do is **specify the sort order as part of the sort field specification**. In other words, instead of `{'sort': 'publication_date', 'order': 'desc'}`, it actually only works if you do `{'sort': 'publication_date desc'}`, even though the documentation says otherwise.\n",
    "2. Regardless of the sorting issues, using sponsoring_org = EE-4S doesn't seem to be working as intended."
